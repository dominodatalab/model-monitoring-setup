# Model Monitoring Example

This folder contains a complete example for training and deploying a model with monitoring.

## Files

- `train_model.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook that trains a Random Forest classifier
- `model.pkl` - Trained model (generated by notebook)
- `model_script.py` - Deployment script for Domino Model API

## Usage

1. **Train the model**: Run `train_model.ipynb` to create the model and training data
2. **Deploy as Model API**: Use `model_script.py` as your deployment script
3. **Test in Domino UI**: Use the sample input below

## Sample Input for Domino Model API Testing

```json
{
  "data": {
    "1_feature": 0.5,
    "2_feature": -0.2,
    "3_feature": 1.1,
    "4_feature": 0.0,
    "5_feature": -0.8,
    "6_feature": 0.3,
    "7_feature": 1.2,
    "8_feature": -0.1,
    "9_feature": 0.7,
    "10_feature": -0.5
  }
}
```

The model expects all 10 features and returns a predicted class (class_1 through class_4) with confidence scores and probabilities.
